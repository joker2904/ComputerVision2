Adaboost::
As per the results plotted, the accuracy of the adaboost classifier increases with the number of iterations ( weak classifiers ). But it saturates after a certain number and it degrades as per the plots.



Tracking Nemo ::
 As per the experiments performed with the Adaboost classifier we implemented, if we create more overlapping training samples then the classification gives unexpected results.

 Non-overlapping image patches, when converted into training sets via the histogram technique gives better classification accuracy .
