1. We ran the training on the tree several times. Because it is randomized , each time the classification results after testing will vary slightly.

2. Same with the forest. Each time the classification result on the forest will vary.

3. On an average the result of training with the forest is a bit better than training with the tree ( as per our observations after running this several times )

4. The tree training is faster than the forest training ( since forest is training several trees in succession ) . Parallelization can make this faster ( we experimentated using multithreading using POSIX threads and saw the results ) .
