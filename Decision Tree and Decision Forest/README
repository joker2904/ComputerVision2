Implement your solution in the file sheet02.cpp in the src directory.
The necessary OpenCV header files are already included.
Your program should run from the terminal with the following command:

./bin/sheet02 images/bonn.png

Please provide any other information required to run your program here...

1. Folder Segment_Output contains the random forest tested images and the comments.
2. src contains the source code.
3. The folders Sherwood_Results_exp_n2 and Sherwood_Results_exp_n4 contains the experimented images. The text file Sherwood_Library_Observations.txt contains the observations.
4. To run the program, the command ./bin/sheet02 is enough ( no need to give arguments ). We have changed the sirectory path inside sheet02.cpp , so it picks up the training and testing files automatically.
