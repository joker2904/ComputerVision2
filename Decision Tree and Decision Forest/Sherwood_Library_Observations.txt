The observations recored here are based on the experiments performed ( the images are attached herewith ).

1) exp_n2 :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depth:
~~~~~~
As per the results we see , increasing the depth of the tree(s) increases the quality of classification. But the growth is slow , i.e, from an increase in depth from 3 to 7 we can actually see a difference in the classification partitions.
A depth of 1 or 2 hardly results in any classification.

Number of Trees in the forest :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Increasing the number of trees results in better classification. But here also the growth is slow. 

Candidate Feature Response :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we make it more than 5, we see an increase in the classification are aligned to the spiral ( 9 or 10 makes it more prominent ).

Candidate ThreshHold :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Increasing it to more than 5 aligns the classification partition towards the spiral. The default value 1 does not do proper classification ( doesn't cover the full spiral area ).


2) exp_n4 :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depth :
~~~~~~~
Increasing the depth results in better classification. This is more prominent here compared to the 2 class spiral.

Trees in Forest :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Increasing the number of trees here does not give better classification to that extent ( very minor change is visible which isn't much effective )

Candidate Feature Response :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The default value 1 does not give a good classification as per the attached images. When we set it to 7 ( or onwards ) we get better classification.

Candidate Theshhold :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As per the images attached, incresing this does not affect the classification much. It remains almost the same.
